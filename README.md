Alternate AndroidLastpass Keyboard for Android
========
An alternate keyboard for lastpass which instantly switches back to your default keyboard after entering the username/password.

Expected to be used with the 'switch to other input method' button on the stock android keyboard, or equivalent, for a single-button password entry which doesn't require you to manually switch back to a usable keyboard afterwards.
